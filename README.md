OPERATIONS ON STACK, QUEUE AND LIST

This program illustrating the operation of data structures such as linked list, stack, and queue is a useful exercise for 
gaining a deeper understanding of how these fundamental data structures work and how they are implemented in programming. 
The aims of this program:

+ Understanding the operation and implementation of basic data structures.
+ Improving programming skills and algorithmic thinking.
+ Practical application of data structures in solving programming problems.

=> This program helps you familiarize yourself with and gain a better understanding of basic data structures and 
how to use them effectively in Java.


HOW TO RUN PROGRAM
- You have to run the file Test.java in file test

Usage:

1. Linked List: Implement a simple linked list using the Node class to store data and a pointer to the next node.
+ "Insert" : Insert a node at a specified index of linkedlist
+ "Remove" : Remove a node at a specified index of linkedlist
+ "Search" : Search a node, display the results on the screen

2. Stack:
+ "Push" : Add 1 node to the top of the stack
+ "Pop" : Remove 1 node at the top of the stack
+ "Peek" : Display the value at the top of the stack

3. Queue:
+ "Enqueue" : Add 1 node to the tail of the queue
+ "Dequeue" : Remove 1 node at the head of the queue
+ "Peek Front" : Display the value at the head of the stack
+ "Peek Back" : Display the value at the tail of the stack
